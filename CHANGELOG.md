project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

* `Error` has a new alternative, `AtError`.
* In `sass::Item`, the `Error`, `MixinCall` and `MixinDeclaration`
  variants is changed to include a `SourcePos`.  Also, a `sass::Mixin`
  contains a `SourcePos` for where it is declared.
* The fields of `SourcePos` is now private.
* The `name` of a `sass::Item::AtRule` is now a SassString.
* PR #118: A `css::Value::Literal` now contains a `CssString` rather
  than a `String` and a `Quotes`.  Evaluating a `SassString` also
  returns a `CssString`.

### Improvements

* A css call is just a special kind of string.
* Include position of directive or function call when reporting
  `@error` errors.
* Improve error reporting from inside mixins and functions.
* Support interpolation in `@`-rule names.
* Fixed #116: The `sass:map.merge` function was buggy.
* Fixed reformatting of to-much-indented comments.


## Release 0.22.2

Released 2021-07-03.
Progress: 4002 of 6180 tests passed in dart-sass compatibility mode.

* Changed the `red(..)`, `green(..)`, and `blue(..)` functions to
  always return integers. Issue #114, thanks @Keats.
* Changed the `blackness(..)` and `whiteness(..)` functions to return
  blackness/whiteness of the integer rgb approximations of the color
  rather than the exact color.


## Release 0.22.0 - 2021-06-20

Progress: 3992 of 6180 tests passed in dart-sass compatibility mode.

### Breaking changes

* The `sass::Item::MixinCall` enum alternative was modified.
* Signature changes in `css::CallArgs` and `sass:CallArgs`,
  and new alternatives in `sass::ArgsError`.
* `css::Value` has a new variant `ArgList`.
* The `OrderMap::keys()` and `values()` functions now returns iterators,
  `OrderMap::remove(key)` now returns the removed value.

### Improvements

* Better handling of mixin call bodies, the `@content` item, and the
  `content_exists` function.  Fixes #112.
* `@import` exposes things `@forward`ed in the imported module.
* Many improvements in parameter passing to functions and mixins.  PR #113.
* Some more fixes regarding function calls and modules.
* Support the `keywords` function in `sass:meta`.
* Removed some debug printouts that was accidentally left in 0.21.0.
* Update sass-spec test suite to 2021-06-14.

Thanks to @Keats for reporting #112 and #108.

  selector functions.  PR #103.
* Implement `meta.module_variables` and `meta.module_functions`.
* Implement `math.div` function.
* Improved parameter checking for `hwb`, `alpha`, and `invert`
  functions in `sass:color` module.
* Support slash-separated lists. PR #111.
* The `if` function evaluates its arguments lazily.  Issue #107.
* The `--include-path` cli argument is now named `--load-path`.
* At least some documentation on all public items.

* The builtin modules does not inherit the global functions.
* Scope names is not `sass::Name` (`$a_b` and `$a-b` is the same
  variable, but `a_b` and `a-b` are different scopes).

Version 0.20.0 was originally released as 0.19.2, but yanked as there
was a breaking change.

## Release 0.19.0 - 2021-03-14

Progress: 3371 of 5945 tests passed in dart-sass compatibility mode.

### Breaking changes

* The unit of a `Numeric` is now a `UnitSet` rather than a `Unit`.
* `Error` has new variants and a new field in `BadArguments`.

  400 tests.  PR #99.
* Fix issue #98: overflow in rational number arithmetic.
* Allow `@at-root` at document root.
* Boolean operators is truly lazy, e.g. `false and f($x)` does not call `f`.

## Release 0.16.0 - 2020-11-10

Progress: 2718 of 5840 tests passed in dart-sass compatibility mode.

### Breaking changes

* `SourceName` and `sass::Item::Import` was changed by #62.
* `Use` was added to the `sass::Item` enum by #80.
* Changes to `sass::Value` and `css::Vaue` by #81.

### Improvements

* PR #80: Implement `@use` for standard sass modules.  All standard
  modules are at least partially supported, only `sass:string` is
  fully supported.  See issue #60 for for module support status.
* PR 82: Implement hwb support in `sass:color`.
  Also, provide `From<Rgba>` for `css::Value` and deprecate color
  value constructors.
* Provide `From<bool>` for `css::Value` (and deprecate `Value::bool(v)`).
* PR #62: Improve `ParseError`, `SourcePos`, and `SourceName` by using
  located spans by [nom_locate](https://lib.rs/crates/nom_locate) in
  the parser.  A `sass::Item::Import` now handles where each file is
  imported from, to improve error reporting.
* PR #81: Improved number handling.  Now `Value::Number` handles both
  machine-sized rationals, bignum rationals and floats internally and
  `Value::NumberBig` is removed.  Also, `Value` no longer implements
  `Ord` but only `PartialOrd`, to handle f64 NaN an infinite values
  correctly.
* Improve parsing of `@else` clauses.
* Update spec to 2020-10-29.

Tested with rustc 1.47.0 (18bf6b4f0 2020-10-07),

## Release 0.15.0 - 2020-10-25

Progress: 2320 of 5577 tests passed in dart-sass compatibility mode.

### Breaking changes

* The `Item::Comment` enum value now contains a `SassString` rather
  than a `String`.
* The `Error::ParseError` enum value changed, and `ErrPos` is replaced
  with `SourcePos` and `SourceName`.
* The error type of `parse_scss_data` changed to `ParseError`.
* `Unit::dimension()` now returns a `Dimension` rather than a `&str`.

### Improvements

* PR #79: Refactor some error handling.  Relates to #46.
* Improve map parsing (a map is parsed as a plain vec of key/value
  pairs, filtering duplicates happens only when it is evaluated).
* Allow multiple `&` items in the same selector.
* `&` evaluates to null when used as a value without enclosing selector.
* Implement the `@debug` directive.
* Fix `a % b` evaluation for negative values.
* Allow / ignore comments in properties and values.
* Allow `!default` and `!global` in any order on variable declarations.
* Improve `inspect(...)` formatting of list values.
* Refactor and improve arithmetic on different units.
* `ListSeparator` is now `Copy`.
* Allow interpolation in comments.
* Some refactoring

  This sets the target when testing and changes some different
  behavior, including how strings are parsed and handled.
* PR #75 from @divergentdave: Parse and add `Value` variants for
  BigInt numbers

## Release 0.13.0 - 2020-04-19

Progress: 1634 of 3502 tests passed in libsass compatibility mode.

* output::Format wraps an output::Style and a precision.  The global
  precision setting is removed.
* Value and other structs no longer implents Display, instead the
  provid a `format` method, that takes an output format and provides a
  Display implementation.
* The `compile_value` rust function now takes a format argument.
* Issue #42 (partial): The `min(..)` and `max(...)` functions are
  handled as plain css functions when valid, while still handling them
  as sass functions when nessecary.
* PR #69, fixing #68: Avoid exponential complexity on parenthesis.
* Allow comments in `@function` bodies.
* PR #67 from @connorskees: Refactor and fix printing of numbers
* When defining multiple variables, having more names than values is
  allowed.  The extra names get null values.
* Convert som panics / unwraps to properly handled errors.
* There was massive restructuring in the test suite, so almost all
  tests moved around.  I moved remaining tests to build a single test
  program for the suite rather than several for different directories
  in the suite (this also means more tests are included in the
  conversion).
* Fix check_spec stats calculation.

## Release 0.11.2 - 2019-12-25

* PR #56:  The url function is special.
  Handle `url(foo)` as simply a string if possible.  Sometimes, such
  as `url("foo" + $bar)`, it must be a function returning a string
  instead.  Partially adresses #42.  Fixes #41.

## Release 0.11.0 - 2019-07-16

Sass-spec reports 1507 of 2865 tests passed in libsass compatibility
mode.

* Update `nom` to version 5.0.
* A string can start with a `#` without being a color.
* Correct parameter name for `unit`, `unitless`, `quote`, and
  `unquote` functions.
* The `random` function ignores units.
* An empty unquoted string behaves like null.
* Fix some issues with string offsets in `str_slice` and `str_insert`.
* The `quote` function can use single quotes when needed.
* Return an error rather than panicing on some invalid scss.
* Some test updates and fixes in spectest.

## Release 0.10.2 - 2019-07-07

Sass-spec reports 1472 of 2802 tests passed in libsass compatibility mode.

* Update progress number in readme and documentation, since I forgot
  in 0.10.0.


## Release 0.10.0 - 2019-07-07

* PR #51: Impove string parsing/escaping.
* Issue #46, PR #47: Report file position of parse errors, and improve
  the parser to have errors reported in a more specific position.
* Improve error handling in functions, calling a function _can_ yield
  an error.  Partially solves #41: The unsupported call will now yield
  an error rather than hang `rsass`.
* Commandline changes:
  - Support `-I` commandline argument for include path.
  - Use lowercase `-v` for version (expected by the test runner).
* Some color function improvements:
  - Handle alpha percentatges in rgba.
  - The rgb function can be used as rgba with four args.
  - Use alpha propely when mixing colors.
  - Handle both alpha and opacity css function fallback.
  - Implement the grayscale function.
  - Support three arguments to `rgba` function.
* Some list function improvements:
  - `inspect` shows parens for empty list, and spells out `"null"` for
    a null value.
  - Join gets better at selecting wether result should be comma or
    space separated.
  - The length function treats a null as an empty list.
  - Handle singleton in `index` and `nth` functions.
* More function improvements:
  - Implement the `unique_id` function.
  - Check that indexes are sane in `str_slice` function.
  - Skip null args even if not last when evaluating a function to a
    function call.
  - Implement equality check for builtin functions.
* Error, not panic, on unknown mixin.
* Allow modifiers on attribute selectors.
* Color names are caseless.
* Improve handling of url imports.
* Update `deunicode` to 1.0 and `rand` to 0.7.0.
* Allow interpolation in namespacerule.
* Allow ";" after body block.
* Lots of test suite updates, including support for .hrx tests in
  spectest.  Target libsass compatibility in testing.

I don't really know if I should target libsass or dart-sass
compatibility, but libsass seems to be closer to my current
